This is a spatially-explicit, stochastic agent-based model for simulating airborne and direct droplet-mediated respiratory pathogen transmission in indoor settings. Its purpose is to quantify the effect of increasing group density on the probability of respiratory pathogen transmission from infectious individuals to susceptible ones, given varied spatial dimension and risk-reduction behavior (e.g., mask use, social distancing, etc.) levels in indoor settings.

The ODD (Overview, Design, and Description) document provides a detailed description of model mechanics.
